Machine Learning Analysis of Donor Dataset

We donâ€™t  really  know which algorithms would be good on this problem 
or what configurations to use. 

We evaluate 7 different algorithms used for classification:

linear models: 
Logistic Regression (LR)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

non linear models
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
RandomForestClassifier (RF)
